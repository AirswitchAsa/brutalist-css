# Brutalist CSS

A brutalist-inspired UI design system for React components.

This is open-sourced by [Spicadust Inc.](https://www.spicadust.com) and the preview is hosted [here](https://spicadust-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/brutalist-css/index.html). There is also an image preview below.

Brutalist CSS is a side project out of our first product [Sphaere](https://dev.sphaere.app), a modern workspace to manage information retrieval and organization. Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui primitives.

## Philosophy

This design system draws inspiration from three influential movements:

**Brutalism** — Raw, honest, and unapologetic. No decorative elements, no rounded corners. Just bold borders, harsh shadows, and high contrast.

**Bauhaus** — Form follows function. Every element serves a purpose. Typography is treated as a visual element with weight and presence.

**Swiss Modern** — Clean grids, systematic spacing, and restrained color palettes. Clarity over complexity.

Our color selection is curated from [和色大辞典](https://colordic.org/w).

## Technical

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Stack**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI

**Structure**:
- `src/components/ui/` — Brutalist-styled components
- `src/index.css` — Design tokens and CSS layer
- `src/App.tsx` — Component showcase
